# Burst2Scene GAN â€“ Project Submission

This repository contains the implementation and demonstration notebook for the **Burst2Scene AI** project, which generates a high-quality scene image from a burst of video frames using a GAN-based architecture.

## ðŸ“¦ Deliverables

The following items are included as part of the final submission:

### âœ… Notebook
- `Burst2Scene_InlinePreview.ipynb` â€“ Complete notebook with:
  - Preprocessing
  - Generator and discriminator loading
  - Inference on burst samples
  - Inline `preview.py` for evaluating trained model (PSNR, SSIM, Confidence)
  - Visual previews saved to `model_preview_dir/`

### âœ… Python Scripts
These scripts are placed in the **project root**:
- `generator_colab.py`
- `discriminator_PatchGAN.py`
- `validation_dataset_colab.py`
- `preview.py`

### âœ… Pretrained Models
These files must be in the **root directory**:
- `generator_last.pth`
- `discriminator_last.pth`

### âœ… Dataset Folders
1. `demo_burst/`  
   - Example burst used in the notebook  
   - At least one folder, e.g. `Validation Video 6_burst_00/` containing `frame_00.jpg` to `frame_09.jpg`  
2. `burst_validation_high_variation/`  
   - Multiple folders like `burst_00/`, `burst_01/` for full evaluation  
   - Each folder should include 10 `.jpg` or `.png` frames  
3. `model_preview_dir/`  
   - Created at runtime to store generated image previews and evaluation metrics  

## ðŸ”§ Setup Instructions

1. **Install dependencies** (virtual environment recommended):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
