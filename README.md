# Burst2Scene: GAN-Based Scene Generation from Burst Frames

This repository contains the implementation of **Burst2Scene**, a deep learning framework that generates a high-resolution, realistic scene image from a burst of low-resolution video frames. The project leverages a ResNet-based generator trained using perceptual and adversarial losses, with a PatchGAN discriminator to enhance local texture realism.

## NOTE
Most of the projects source code and files are too large to upload to GitHub. Please Contact for the source code demonstration

## Key Features

- Burst-to-image scene reconstruction from temporally adjacent frames
- Generator trained using perceptual + total variation + adversarial loss
- PatchGAN discriminator with spectral normalisation for local realism
- Preview script for side-by-side output evaluation
- Metric evaluation using SSIM, PSNR, and optional FID

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch â‰¥ 1.12
- torchvision
- numpy, matplotlib, tqdm, PIL
- (Optional) Google Colab Pro/Pro+ for faster training

Install requirements:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Download all the files in this GitHub repository.

## Requirements
Version 1 (Perceptual-only, no discriminator):
```python train_colab.py```

Version 2 (PatchGAN adversarial training):
```python train_colab_PatchGAN.py```
* Make sure to load the pre-trained generator from final_GAN_v1_generator.pth before starting adversarial fine-tuning


## Running the model
```train.py```: run script to train model
```train_colab.py```: run in google colab with A1000 gpu, this trains the model
```preview.py```: uses the trained model by exposing them to unseen bursts images



## Previewing Outputs
Run the preview script to visualise model output on the validation set:
```
python preview.py --checkpoint checkpoints/final_GAN_v2_generator.pth
```
* Output images will be saved under the previews/ directory.
