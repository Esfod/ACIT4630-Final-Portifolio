# Burst2Scene: GAN-Based Scene Generation from Burst Frames

This repository contains the implementation of **Burst2Scene**, a deep learning framework that generates a high-resolution, realistic scene image from a burst of low-resolution video frames. The project leverages a ResNet-based generator trained using perceptual and adversarial losses, with a PatchGAN discriminator to enhance local texture realism.
